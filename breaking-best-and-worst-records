Maria plays  games of college basketball in a season. Because she wants to go pro, she tracks her points scored per game sequentially in an array defined as . After each game , she checks to see if score  breaks her record for most or least points scored so far during that season.

Given Maria's array of  for a season of  games, find and print the number of times she breaks her record for most and least points scored during the season.
