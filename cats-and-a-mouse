/*
Two cats named  and  are standing at integral points on the x-axis. Cat  is standing at point  and cat  is standing at point . Both cats run at the same speed, and they want to catch a mouse named  that's hiding at integral point  on the x-axis. Can you determine who will catch the mouse?

You are given  queries in the form of , , and . For each query, print the appropriate answer on a new line:

If cat  catches the mouse first, print Cat A.
If cat  catches the mouse first, print Cat B.
If both cats reach the mouse at the same time, print Mouse C as the two cats fight and mouse escapes.
