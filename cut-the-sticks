/*
You are given  sticks, where the length of each stick is a positive integer. A cut operation is performed on the sticks such that all of them are reduced by the length of the smallest stick.

Suppose we have six sticks of the following lengths:

5 4 4 2 2 8
Then, in one cut operation we make a cut of length 2 from each of the six sticks. For the next cut operation four sticks are left (of non-zero length), whose lengths are the following: 

3 2 2 6
The above step is repeated until no sticks are left.

Given the length of  sticks, print the number of sticks that are left before each subsequent cut operations.
