Aerith is playing a cloud game! In this game, there are  clouds numbered sequentially from to . Each cloud is either an ordinary cloud or a thundercloud.

Aerith starts out on cloud  with energy level . She can use  unit of energy to make a jump of size  to cloud , and she jumps until she gets back to cloud . If Aerith lands on a thundercloud, her energy () decreases by  additional units. The game ends when Aerith lands back on cloud .

Given the values of , , and the configuration of the clouds, can you determine the final value of  after the game ends?
