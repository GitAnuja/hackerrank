Lily likes to play games with integers and their reversals. For some integer , we define  to be the reversal of all digits in . For example, , , and .

Logan wants to go to the movies with Lily on some day  satisfying , but he knows she only goes to the movies on days she considers to be beautiful. Lily considers a day to be beautiful if the absolute value of the difference between  and  is evenly divisible by .

Given , , and , count and print the number of beautiful days when Logan and Lily can go to the movies.
