/*
Flatland is a country with  cities,  of which have space stations. Each city, , is numbered with a distinct index from  to , and each city  is connected to city  by a bidirectional road that is  in length.

For example, if  and cities  and  have space stations, then Flatland looks like this:

For each city, determine its distance to the nearest space station and print the maximum of these distances.
